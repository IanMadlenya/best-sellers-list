These famous words are now synonymous with the dynamic husband-and-wife team Chip and Joanna Gaines, stars of HGTV s Fixer Upper. As this question fills the airwaves with anticipation, their legions of fans continue to multiply and ask a different series of questions, like Who are these people?What s the secret to their success? And is Chip actually that funny in real life? By renovating homes in Waco, Texas, and changing lives in such a winsome and engaging way, Chip and Joanna have become more than just the stars of Fixer Upper, they have become America s new best friends.

The Magnolia Story is the first book from Chip and Joanna, offering their fans a detailed look at their life together. From the very first renovation project they ever tackled together, to the project that nearly cost them everything; from the childhood memories that shaped them, to the twists and turns that led them to the life they share on the farm today.

They both attended Baylor University in Waco. However, their paths did not cross until Chip checked his car into the local Firestone tire shop where Joanna worked behind the counter. Even back then Chip was a serial entrepreneur who, among other things, ran a lawn care company, sold fireworks, and flipped houses. Soon they were married and living in their first fixer upper. Four children and countless renovations later, Joanna garners the attention of a television producer who notices her work on a blog one day.

In The Magnolia Story fans will finally get to join the Gaines behind the scenes and discover: The time Chip ran to the grocery store and forgot to take their new, sleeping baby Joanna s agonizing decision to close her dream business to focus on raising their children When Chip buys a houseboat, sight-unseen, and it turns out to be a leaky wreck Joanna s breakthrough moment of discovering the secret to creating a beautiful home Harrowing stories of the financial ups and downs as an entrepreneurial couple Memories and photos from Chip and Jo s wedding The significance of the word magnolia and why it permeates everything they do The way the couple pays the popularity of Fixer Upper forward, sharing the success with others, and bolstering the city of Waco along the way

And yet there is still one lingering question for fans of the show: Is Chip really that funny? Oh yeah, says Joanna. He was, and still is, my first fixer upper. "

He asks the question: what makes high-achievers different?

His answer is that we pay too much attention to what successful people are like, and too little attention to where they are from: that is, their culture, their family, their generation, and the idiosyncratic experiences of their upbringing. Along the way he explains the secrets of software billionaires, what it takes to be a great soccer player, why Asians are good at math, and what made the Beatles the greatest rock band. 

Brilliant and entertaining, Outliers is a landmark work that will simultaneously delight and illuminate.

Why do some people succeed and others fail? Sharing new insights from her landmark research on grit, Angela Duckworth explains why talent is hardly a guarantor of success. Rather, other factors can be even more crucial such as identifying our passions and following through on our commitments.

Drawing on her own powerful story as the daughter of a scientist who frequently bemoaned her lack of smarts, Duckworth describes her winding path through teaching, business consulting, and neuroscience, which led to the hypothesis that what really drives success is not genius, but a special blend of passion and long-term perseverance. As a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, Duckworth created her own character lab and set out to test her theory.

Here, she takes readers into the field to visit teachers working in some of the toughest schools, cadets struggling through their first days at West Point, and young finalists in the National Spelling Bee. She also mines fascinating insights from history and shows what can be gleaned from modern experiments in peak performance. Finally, she shares what she's learned from interviewing dozens of high achievers; from JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon to the cartoon editor of The New Yorker to Seattle Seahawks Coach Pete Carroll.

Winningly personal, insightful, and even life-changing, Grit is a book about what goes through your head when you fall down, and how that not talent or luck makes all the difference.

 ¬†
 ‚ÄúFor the last two years, I‚Äôve interviewed nearly two hundred world-class performers for my podcast, [3mThe Tim Ferriss Show. [0mThe guests range from super celebs (Jamie Foxx, Arnold Schwarzenegger, etc.) and athletes (icons of powerlifting, gymnastics, surfing, etc.) to legendary Special Operations commanders and black-market biochemists. For most of my guests, it‚Äôs the first time they‚Äôve agreed to a two-to-three-hour interview, and the show is on the cusp of¬†passing 100 million downloads.
 ¬†
 ‚ÄúThis book contains the distilled tools, tactics, and ‚Äòinside baseball‚Äô you won‚Äôt find anywhere else. It also includes new tips from past guests, and life lessons from new ‚Äòguests‚Äô you haven‚Äôt met.
 ¬†
 ‚ÄúWhat makes the show different is a relentless focus on actionable details. This is reflected in the questions. For example: What do these people do in the first sixty minutes of each morning? What do their workout routines look like, and why? What books have they gifted most to other people? What are the biggest wastes of time for novices in their field? What supplements do they take on a daily basis?
 ¬†
 ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt view myself as an interviewer. I view myself as an experimenter. If I can‚Äôt test something and replicate results in the messy reality of everyday life, I‚Äôm not interested.
 ¬†
 ‚ÄúEverything within these pages has been vetted, explored, and applied to my own life in some fashion. I‚Äôve used dozens of the tactics and philosophies in high-stakes negotiations, high-risk environments, or large business dealings. The lessons have made me millions of dollars and saved me years of wasted effort and frustration.
 ¬†
 ‚ÄúI created this book, my ultimate notebook of high-leverage tools, for myself. It‚Äôs changed my life, and I hope the same for you.‚Äù

In the international bestseller, [3mThinking, Fast and Slow[0m, Daniel Kahneman, the renowned psychologist and winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics, takes us on a groundbreaking tour of the mind and explains the two systems that drive the way we think. System 1 is fast, intuitive, and emotional; System 2 is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. The impact of overconfidence on corporate strategies, the difficulties of predicting what will make us happy in the future, the profound effect of cognitive biases on everything from playing the stock market to planning our next vacation‚Äîeach of these can be understood only by knowing how the two systems shape our judgments and decisions. 
Engaging the reader in a lively conversation about how we think, Kahneman reveals where we can and cannot trust our intuitions and how we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking. He offers practical and enlightening insights into how choices are made in both our business and our personal lives‚Äîand how we can use different techniques to guard against the mental glitches that often get us into trouble. Winner of the National Academy of Sciences Best Book Award and the Los Angeles Times Book Prize and selected by [3mThe New York Times Book Review[0m as one of the ten best books of 2011, Thinking[3m, Fast and Slow[0m is destined to be a classic.

In 1962, fresh out of business school, Phil Knight borrowed $50 from his father and created a company with a simple mission: import high-quality, low-cost athletic shoes from Japan. Selling the shoes from the trunk of his lime green Plymouth Valiant, Knight grossed $8,000 his first year. Today, Nike‚Äôs annual sales top $30 billion. In an age of startups, Nike is the [3mne plus ultra[0m of all startups, and the swoosh has become a revolutionary, globe-spanning icon, one of the most ubiquitous and recognizable symbols in the world today.

But Knight, the man behind the swoosh, has always remained a mystery. Now, for the first time, in a memoir that is candid, humble, gutsy, and wry, he tells his story, beginning with his crossroads moment. At 24, after backpacking around the world, he decided to take the unconventional path, to start his own business‚Äîa business that would be dynamic, [3mdifferent.[0m

Knight details the many risks and daunting setbacks that stood between him and his dream‚Äîalong with his early triumphs. Above all, he recalls the formative relationships with his first partners and employees, a ragtag group of misfits and seekers who became a tight-knit band of brothers. Together, harnessing the transcendent power of a shared mission, and a deep belief in the spirit of sport, they built a brand that changed everything.

In [3mOriginals[0m he again addresses the challenge of improving the world, but now from the perspective of becoming original: choosing to champion novel ideas and values that go against the grain, battle conformity, and buck outdated traditions. How can we originate new ideas, policies, and practices without risking it all?

Using surprising studies and stories spanning business, politics, sports, and entertainment, Grant explores how to recognize a good idea, speak up without getting silenced, build a coalition of allies, choose the right time to act, and manage fear and doubt; how parents and teachers can nurture originality in children; and how leaders can build cultures that welcome dissent. Learn from an entrepreneur who pitches his start-ups by highlighting the reasons not to invest, a woman at Apple who challenged Steve Jobs from three levels below, an analyst who overturned the rule of secrecy at the CIA, a billionaire financial wizard who fires employees for failing to criticize him, and a TV executive who didn‚Äôt even work in comedy but saved [3mSeinfeld [0mfrom the cutting-room floor. The payoff is a set of groundbreaking insights about rejecting conformity and improving the status quo.


[33m#9|                 Leaders Eat Last                 |[39m	[31mby Simon Sinek[39m ISBN: 9781591848011	[1mThe New York Times¬†bestselling follow-up to Simon Sinek's global hit¬†Start With Why[0m

Why do only a few people¬†get to say ‚ÄúI love my job‚Äù?¬†It seems unfair that finding fulfillment at¬†work is like winning a lottery; that only a¬†few lucky ones get to feel valued by their¬†organizations, to feel like they belong.

Imagine a world where almost everyone wakes¬†up inspired to go to work, feels trusted and valued¬†during the day, then returns home feeling fulfilled.

This is not a crazy, idealized notion. Today, in¬†many successful organizations, great leaders are¬†creating environments in which people naturally¬†work together to do remarkable things.¬†

In his travels around the world since the publication¬†of his bestseller¬†[3mStart with Why[0m, Simon Sinek¬†noticed that some teams were able to trust each other¬†so deeply that they would literally put their lives on¬†the line for each other. Other teams, no matter what¬†incentives were offered, were doomed to infighting,¬†fragmentation and failure. Why?

The answer became clear during a conversation¬†with a Marine Corps general.¬†

‚ÄúOfficers eat last,‚Äù he said.

Sinek watched as the most junior Marines ate¬†first while the most senior Marines took their place¬†at the back of the line. What‚Äôs symbolic in the chow¬†hall is deadly serious on the battlefield: great leaders¬†sacrifice their own comfort‚Äîeven their own survival‚Äîfor the good of those in their care.

This principle has been true since the earliest¬†tribes of hunters and gatherers. It‚Äôs not a management¬†theory; it‚Äôs biology. Our brains and bodies evolved¬†to help us find food, shelter, mates and especially¬†safety. We‚Äôve always lived in a dangerous world,¬†facing predators and enemies at every turn. We¬†thrived only when we felt safe among our group.

Our biology hasn‚Äôt changed in fifty thousand¬†years, but our environment certainly has. Today‚Äôs¬†workplaces tend to be full of cynicism, paranoia¬†and self-interest. But the best organizations foster¬†trust and cooperation because their leaders build¬†what Sinek calls a Circle of Safety that separates the¬†security inside the team from the challenges outside.

The Circle of Safety leads to stable, adaptive,¬†confident teams, where everyone feels they belong¬†and all energies are devoted to facing the common¬†enemy and seizing big opportunities.¬†

As he did in[3m¬†Start with Why[0m, Sinek illustrates¬†his ideas with fascinating true stories from a wide¬†range of examples, from the military to manufacturing,¬†from government to investment banking.

The biology is clear: when it matters most, leaders¬†who are willing to eat last are rewarded with¬†deeply loyal colleagues who will stop at nothing to advance their leader‚Äôs vision and their organization‚Äôs¬†interests. It‚Äôs amazing how well it works.
